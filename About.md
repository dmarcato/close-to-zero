# Instructions #

The goal of the game is to keep the sum of your rows and columns as close as possible to zero.

At every turn, you must enter a number in a free cell. You can't enter the same number in two adjacent cells. The cells marked with the symbol "-" subtract the number, those with the "+" sum it. The total of each row and column corresponds to the distance from 0.

Whoever has the minimum score once filled the grid wins.
